Continuous integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are two essential components of both Agile and DevOps toolchains that lead to successful software development. CI/CD helps ensure that code is always in a releasable state and that new features and bug fixes reach customers as quickly as possible.

Benefits to using CI/CD in software development projects, including:
- Faster delivery of new features and bug fixes
- Improved software quality
- Reduced risk
- Improved collaboration
